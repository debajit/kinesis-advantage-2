# Kinesis Advantage 2 Keyboard Configuration

My mappings and macros for the Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard.

# Updating the Firmware

From the official Kinesis docs:

1. Obtain the appropriate version of Advantage2 firmware (“.upd” file) from Kinesis tech support or the link below.
2. If Power User Mode has not been enabled, do so now (progm + shift + esc). All 4 LEDs will flash 4 times.
3. Open the v-drive (progm + F1).
4. Navigate to the “Kinesis KB” removable drive in File Explorer (or equivalent) & open the “firmware” folder.
5. Copy and paste the new firmware file into the firmware folder.
6. Rename the firmware file “update.upd”.
7. Initiate Firmware Update (program + shift + U). The update process normally takes 10-12 seconds to complete, during which time the keyboard will be inactive. IMPORANT NOTE: Do NOT unplug or type on the keyboard during this step. To test if done, you can tap the “keypad” function key and monitor the LED.
8. After 12 seconds, tap the Keypad key to test the keyboard. When the keypad LED illuminates the keyboard is active again.
9. Run a Status Report to confirm the new version of firmware was successfully installed.
10. If the keyboard does not wake up after 12-15 seconds, perform a Hard Reset (Progm + F9 while plugging it in).
